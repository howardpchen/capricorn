<b>Capricorn Terms of Service ("Agreement")</b>
<p>
This Agreement was last modified on July 4, 2014.
<p>
Please read these Terms of Service completely using Capricorn (the Software) which is created by Po-Hao Chen, MD, MBA, Yin Jie Chen, MD, and supervised by Tessa Cook, MD, PhD, at the Hospital of University of Pennsylvania.  By using or accessing the Software in any way, viewing or browsing the Software, or adding your own content to the Software, you are agreeing to be bound by these Terms of Service.
<p>
Disclaimer
<p>
The use of Capricorn is entirely voluntary.  Although much effort is made to improve Capricorn, the Software makes no guarentee for its accuracy.  It is your sole responsibility to verify the content and accuracy of Capricorn's data for any purpose.  Capricorn depends on an underlying radiology information system (RIS) for its functionality and has no control over the content, accuracy, timeliness, or reliability of RIS.
<p>
Intellectual Property
<p>
The Software and all of its original content are the properties of its creators, as such, fully protected by the appropriate international copyright and other intellectual property rights laws.  The Software is licensed under the GNU General Public License.  For more information, visit http://capricornradiology.org/.
<p>
The Capricorn database is IRB-approved for research.  Contact us (email Po-Hao.Chen@uphs.upenn.edu) for details of its IRB prior to using Capricorn in research.  An IRB is not necessary for viewing your own data.

Changes to This Agreement
<p>
Capricorn reserves the right to modify these Terms of Service at any time. We do so by posting and drawing attention to the updated terms on the Software. Your decision to continue to visit and make use of the Software after such changes have been made constitutes your formal acceptance of the new Terms of Service.
<p>
Therefore, we ask that you check and review this Agreement for such changes on an occasional basis. Should you not agree to any provision or any changes we make to the Agreement, we ask and advise that you stop accessing Capricorn immediately.
